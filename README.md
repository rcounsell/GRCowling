# GR Cowling: Gravity and Interface Modes

This project represents an implementation of the general relativistic Cowling approximation in neutron-star seismology. It was developed to support <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/536/2/1967/7920787?login=false"> Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 536, 1967 (2025)</a> and other work in preparation.

## Installation

The software is developed using the python programming language.

## Getting Started

The general functions are found in the ModeSolver.py file. Examples of how to use them are in the Notebooks and can be run using python.
